# Canvas Utility Scripts
This repository includes some scripts that I developed for grading and uploading grades with Canvas, as a TA for CSE 6140 (CSE Algorithms) taught by Prof. Umit Catalyurek in Fall 2018 at Georgia Tech.

* <code>grade_pdfs.py</code> can be used for quickly grading multiple PDF submissions. I found it especially useful for the class because of the number of students enrolled in the class.
